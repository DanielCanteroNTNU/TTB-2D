# TTB-2D
Train-Track-Bridge interaction simulation tool for Matlab

The software TTB-2D simulates the dynamic response of a Train-Track-Bridge system in a 2D representation. The train is represented as a succession of multiple vehicles. The track includes rail irregularities and models the rail, pad, sleeper, ballast, and sub-ballast. The bridge is modelled as a beam in finite element formulation with customizable support conditions, which effectively enables the representation of a wide range of structural configurations. This validated numerical model accounts for the vehicle-infrastructure interaction.
